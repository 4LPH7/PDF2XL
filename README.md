# PDF Table Extractor to Excel

This Python script extracts table data from a PDF file, cleans it, and writes the cleaned data into an Excel file with formatting applied. It uses the `pdfplumber` library to extract tables and the `openpyxl` library to create and format the Excel file.

---

## Features

- **Extract Tables from PDF**: Extracts table data from a PDF file using `pdfplumber`.
- **Clean Data**: Removes empty or `None` values and filters out rows with no meaningful data.
- **Write to Excel**: Writes the cleaned data to an Excel file with formatting:
  - Bold and centered headers with a yellow background.
  - Left-aligned data cells.
  - Borders around all cells.
  - Automatic column width adjustment.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for missing input files and handles cases where no valid table data is found.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pdfplumber`, `openpyxl`, `pandas` (optional, not used in the script but imported)

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Input PDF**:
   - Place the PDF file (`test.pdf`) in the project directory, or update the `pdf_path` variable in the script to point to your PDF file.

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your script file.

3. **Check the Output**:
   - The script will generate an Excel file (`output.xlsx`) in the same directory.
   - Open the file to view the extracted and formatted table data.

## Customization

- **Input PDF Path**:
  Update the `pdf_path` variable in the `main()` function to point to your desired PDF file.

- **Output Excel Path**:
  Update the `output_path` variable in the `main()` function to specify where the Excel file should be saved.

- **Formatting**:
  Modify the formatting in the `write_cleaned_data_to_excel` function to suit your needs. For example:
  - Change the header font, alignment, or background color.
  - Adjust the border style or cell alignment.



## Error Handling

- If the input PDF file is not found, the script will print an error message and exit.
- If no valid table data is found in the PDF, the script will notify the user and exit.
